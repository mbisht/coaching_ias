                                    <p>To emerge as a pre-eminent IAS Academy that aims to work for the holistic enhancement of society by enabling the young and bright minds of the country to help them realize their dreams of becoming civil servants thereby pushing India into the comity of developed nation. We want to build steel pillar that was the dream of our first Deputy Prime Minister of India, Shri Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Our civil servants have contributed significantly in transforming India from colonial era to modern era.

We will help you to become the part of that steel pillar which will fulfill the dream of Shri A.P.J Abdul Kalam to catapult India into a prosperous and developed country where people will come to know about poverty only in history books, not in their daily life.</p>
